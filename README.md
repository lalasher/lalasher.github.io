# About Me
## My interests
      - I enjoy weight lifting, gaming, building computers and hiking. I had been in the engineering transfer pathway but now want to get my Cyber Security Associates. I would like to eventually work from home as  I am an introvert and dislike too much interaction. Outside of those I do not have many interests other than maybe food which is basic but it fixes all issues for me. Covid dulled me down quite a bit in terms of this section where I used to be more social, enjoyed soccer and being out and about whereas now I enjoy my small circle.
## Websites I recommend
      - [Youtube] (https://www.youtube.com) - I find Youtube interesting because they have everything A-Z from information, persuasion, or entertainment. This can be a good or bad resource dependent upon the user and their intentions while using this platform.
      - [Google Scholar] (https://scholar.google.com) - I find Google Scholar interesting because it is a great resource for school research or really as the information is accurate. This has been a life saver from research papers to needing reputable sources but other than academic work there is not much.
